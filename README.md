# Introduction
Auto switch target language for Google Translate when source language is the same with target language. 

When people use Google Translate, they often want to translate between two languages, A and B. When a user inputs text in language A and translates it into language B, the browser saves language B as the target language. However, if the user later inputs text in language B, the output will remain the same as the input because the target language is also set to B.
